#Bringing it all together (1)

#In the filter () call, pass a lambda function and the sequence of tweets as strings tweets_df['text']. 
#The lambda function should check if the first 2 characters in a tweet x are 'RT'. Assign the resulting filter object to result.
#To get the first 2 characters in a tweet x, use x[0:2]. To check equality, use a Boolean filter with ==.


# Select retweets from the Twitter DataFrame: result. Added this code to remind myself of the syntax for lambda functions. I didn't find datacamp very clear in the explanation of adding the column you at the end of the function header
result = filter(lambda x: x[0:2] == 'RT', tweets_df['text'])

# Create list from filter object result: res_list
res_list = list(result)

# Print all retweets in res_list
for tweet in res_list:
    print(tweet)
